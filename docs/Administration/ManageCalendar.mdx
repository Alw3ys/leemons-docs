# Manage Academic Calendar

You can define the beginning and end of each course of the program and also the breaks.

:::tip DON'T WORRY ABOUT TIMETABLE
Leemons' intelligent system recognizes the class schedules provided in Academic Portfolio and creates a personalized schedule for each student. In this way, you do not need to establish which class timetable corresponds to each program, because the timetable is built in an automated way.
