# Manage Academic Portafolio

Thanks to our Academic Portfolio management, an administrator user can create from complex programs such as a primary education, a high school program or a university degree, to small courses or Moocs.

## Welcome

In this first section you could review some help tips about the best way to create an successfully academic portfolio

- Link profiles (if you create a custom profiles, you have to indicate to the platform which of them correspond to teachers and students
- Create programs (Primary, secondary, high school, bachelor's degree, master's... here the programs offered by the organization are created.)
- Add subjects (you can add subjects for each program and course)
- Portfolio tree (allows you to define the most convenient type of tree to manage the educational program (assign students, edit information or create segmented groups).

## Learning programs

Elementary, High School, Bachelor, Masters, and more. Define the programs and courses offered in your organization. If you do not have traditional stages, you can create simple programs or courses instead.

## Subjects

Configure knowledge areas/topics and type (core, electivesâ€¦), then it is possible to upload the subject database or add them manually. After this, you are ready to create your tree portfolio schema.

## Portfolio tree

This is your Portfolio Tree, it can be edited, duplicated or used to create new elements for your program. Students can also be assigned at any level (all subjects under it will inherit this task).
