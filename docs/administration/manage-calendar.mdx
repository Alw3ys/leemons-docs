# Manage Academic Calendar

You can define the beginning and end of each course of the program and also the breaks.

:::caution DON'T WORRY ABOUT SCHEDULE
Leemons' intelligent system recognizes the class schedules provided in Academic Portfolio and creates a personalized schedule for each student. In this way, you do not need to establish which class timetable corresponds to each program, because the timetable is built in an automated way.

To enable this functionality, you have to set the start and end date of each related course (and save them).
