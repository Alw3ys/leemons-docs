# Manage Academic Calendar

It is possible to define the beginning and end of each course of the program and also define the breaks throughout the course.

:::caution DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE SCHEDULE
Leemons' intelligent system recognizes the class schedules provided in the Academic Portfolio and creates a personalized schedule for each student. In this way, it is not necessary to establish which class timetable corresponds to each program, because the timetable is built in an automated way.

To enable this functionality, it is necessary to set the start and end date of each related course (and save them).
