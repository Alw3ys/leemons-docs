# Installation

Leemons is essentially a set of npm [packages](https://github.com/leemonade/leemons/tree/main/packages).

## 1. Requirements

### Node.js

All the Leemons packages are built in Javascript, so you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) in order to compile and run it.
The version required is 16.14 or above, you can check it by running in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
```

You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed.

### Yarn

We use [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) for managing dependencies, because of the way it handle `workspaces` in monorepos.

Once you have [npm](#nodejs) installed you can run the following to install Yarn:

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

## 2. Database

Leemons will be prepared to support both SQL and NoSQL databases, but in the beta version we support only a SQL database.
Follow the installation process for your preferred database:

- MySQL [macOS](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/macos-installation.html) | [Windows](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/windows-installation.html) | [Linux](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/linux-installation.html) | [Linux](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/linux-installation.html)
- PostgreSQL [macOS](https://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx) | [Windows](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows) | [Linux](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux)

:::tip MACOS Users
On macOS, you can install MySQL easily using [Homebrew](https://flaviocopes.com/homebrew).

Run:

```bash
brew install mysql
```

and finally:

```bash
brew services start mysql
```

:::

### Database setup

Once the database engine is installed, a database must be created for use in Leemons.

For the purposes of this documentation, we will always be working with the following database configuration:

```json
{
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 3306,
  "user": "leemons",
  "password": "leemons",
  "database": "leemons"
}
```

<details>
  <summary>MySQL</summary>

Let's create a database named `leemons` in your existing MySQL installation. So, in your `mysql` console, run the following commands:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `leemons` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'leemons'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'leemons';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON leemons.* TO 'leemons'@'localhost';
flush privileges;
```

</details>

## 3. Download

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="direct" label="Direct" default>

  }
>

</Button>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="git" label="Clone with git">

You need [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to be installed in your machine, you can check it by running in your terminal:

```bash
git --version
```

To clone the repository, you can use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leemonade/leemons.git
```

### Project structure {#project-structure}

Assuming you have already downloaded or cloneded Leemons to a directory named `my-leemons`, you will see the following minimal structure (we hide some folders and files for display purposes):

```bash
my-leemons
├── examples
│   └── demo
├── packages
│   ├── leemons
│   ├── leemons-utils
│   ├── leemons-database
│   ├── leemons-plugin-academic-calendar
│   ├── leemons-plugin-academic-portfolio
│   ├── leemons-plugin-assignables
│   ├── leemons-plugin-bulk-template
│   ├── leemons-plugin-calendar
│   ├── leemons-plugin-curriculum
│   ├── leemons-plugin-dashboard
│   ├── leemons-plugin-dataset
│   ├── leemons-plugin-emails

```

### Project structure rundown {#project-structure-rundown}

- `/examples/` - Contains the applications examples.
  - `/examples/demo/` - Contains the demo application we will use in this documentation.
- `/packages/` - Contains all the [plugins](../category/plugins) and [packages](../category/packages) of Leemons.

## 4. Database connection configuration

You can set up the database connection configuration by creating a `.env` file inside the `my-leemons/examples/demo` folder like this:

```bash title="/examples/demo/.env"
DATABASE_DATABASE=leemons
DATABASE_USERNAME=root
DATABASE_PASSWORD=admin
DATABASE_PORT=3306
DATABASE_HOST=127.0.0.1
```

## 5. Bulk data creation template configuration

While we finish developing our Welcome Wizard, Leemons allows you to install the platform thanks to our "Bulk Templates".

These templates allow you to choose between three different programmes according to your needs and can be customized at a later stage.

:::tip Download the template and see the tutorial
The easiest way to understand how our template works is to watch this short video tutorial.

### Template file

Once you have downloaded and completed the template file, rename it to `data.xlsx` and copy it to the folder:

`my-leemons/packages/leemons-plugin-bulk-templates/src/bulk/data.xlsx`

```bash
my-leemons
└── packages
    └── leemons-plugin-bulk-template
        └── src
            └── bulk
                └── data.xlsx
```

## 6. Dependencies

Navigate to `my-leemons/examples/demo` folder and run the following command to install all the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

## 7. Run your Leemons 🚀

You need to launch 2 servers in order to run Leemons:

### Backend server

Still inside `my-leemons/examples/demo` folder, run the following command to start the demo application backend:

```bash
yarn dev
```

:::caution BE PATIENT
Depending on the resources of your machine and the amount of template data to be uploaded, the bulk upload process can take between 15 and 20 minutes.
:::

If everything has gone well, the bulk data loading of the template will start and once completed, the following message will be displayed on the terminal:

```bash
BULK DONE Template loaded
```

#### Re-launch the application

In order to check if everything has gone well, kill or close the current terminal and re-launch the application by running again `yarn dev`

If everything has gone well, this time you will see the following message:

```bash
Listening on http://localhost:8080
```

### Frontend server

In a new terminal, navigate to `my-leemons/examples/demo` folder again and run the following command to start the demo application frontend:

```bash
yarn front
```

:::caution IMPORTANT
Don't kill or close your terminal while the servers are running, otherwise the servers will stop and the application will terminate.
:::

## 8. Test your Leemons 👩‍💻

If everything has gone as expected, you can now test your Leemons application by opening the following URL in your browser [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
