# Docker Installation

Leemons can be installed as a containerized app. This is useful for automatizing processes and avoiding installing all the needed dependencies on your system.

## 1. Requirements

### Docker and Docker Compose

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) allows us to deploy all the necessary parts for leemons to work, making it fast, easy, and predictable. We use the [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) tool for managing the multi-container deployment, so you need to do less work and enjoy Leemons quicker!

You can install Docker and Docker Compose through [their website](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## 2. Download

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="direct" label="Direct" default>

You can download the latest version of Leemons directly from Github.

<Box style={{ marginBottom: 40 }}>
  <Button
    rightIcon={<DownloadIcon />}
    onClick={() =>
      window.open('https://github.com/leemonade/leemons/archive/refs/heads/main.zip', '_blank')
    }
  >
    Download Leemons
  </Button>
</Box>

:::note DIRECTORY NAMING
For the purposes of this documentation, we are assuming that the folder generated by the archive, once unzipped, will be named `my-leemons`.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="git" label="Clone with git">

You need [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to be installed in your machine, you can check it by running in your terminal:

```bash
git --version
```

Navigate to the path where you want to download Leemons. For the purposes of this documentation, the destination path will be `my-leemons`.

Then clone the repository:

```bash
cd my-leemons
git clone https://github.com/leemonade/leemons.git .
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Project structure

Assuming you have already downloaded or cloned Leemons to a directory named `my-leemons`, you will see the following minimal structure (we hide some folders and files for display purposes):

```bash

### Project structure rundown

- `/docker/` - Contains the docker files needed to run Leemons.
- `/examples/` - Contains the applications examples.
  - `/examples/docker/` - Contains the docker application we will use in this documentation.
- `/packages/` - Contains all the [plugins](../category/plugins) and [packages](../category/packages) of Leemons.

## 3. Bulk data creation template configuration

While we finish developing our Welcome Wizard, Leemons allows you to install the platform thanks to our "Bulk Templates".

These templates allow you to choose between three different programs according to your needs and can be customized at a later stage.

:::caution Download the template and see the tutorial
The easiest way to understand how our template works is to watch this short video tutorial.

When open the Google spreadsheet file, please, create a copy first if you want to edit.

### Template file

Once you have downloaded and completed the template file, rename it to `data.xlsx` and copy it to the folder:

`my-leemons/packages/leemons-plugin-bulk-templates/src/bulk/data.xlsx`

```bash
my-leemons
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ packages
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ leemons-plugin-bulk-template
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bulk
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data.xlsx
```

:::caution IMPORTANT
In case you have not set up an external storage provider, check that the following folder exists:

`my-leemons/packages/leemons-plugin-leebrary/files`

If the folder does not exist, please create it.

## 4. Database

Leemons is prepared to support both SQL and NoSQL databases. In the beta version, we only support a SQL database.

In Leemons for Docker, you will only need to set up the database, and we will keep in charge of everything else.

To provide the database config, you must create the following file:

```json title=/examples/docker/.env
DATABASE_DATABASE=leemons
DATABASE_USERNAME=leemons
DATABASE_PASSWORD=leemons
```

You can change the name, username and password.

## 5. Run your Leemons üöÄ{#runYourLeemons}

The deployed directory will be DIRECTORY, but you must go to DOCKER DIRECTORY and run the docker app.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="linux" label="macOS and Linux" default>
The installation For macOS and Linux is as easy as running from the terminal:

The directory must be `/docker`.

```bash
sh start.sh
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
Windows has no automated launch right now, but you can run it from the terminal as follows:

The directory must be `/docker`.

Firstly, we launch leemons terminating the old-unused containers in detached mode, so we can still use the terminal:

```bash
docker compose up -d --remove-orphans --env-file ../examples/docker/.env
```

Once the app is up and running, we will install the dependencies if needed (the command will decide if it is needed or not) by the command:

```bash
docker compose exec leemons-yarn-install sh installDeps.sh
```

Finally, we will follow the app output so you can know when everything is ready to enjoy Leemons:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 6. Test your Leemons üë©‚Äçüíª

Once the frontend server ir running, test your Leemons application by opening the main URL [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.
