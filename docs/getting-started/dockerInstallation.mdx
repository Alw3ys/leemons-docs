# Docker Installation

Leemons can be installed as a containerized app. This is useful for automatizing processes and avoiding the need for installing all the required dependencies on your system.

## 1. Requirements

### Docker and Docker Compose

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) makes it possible to deploy all the necessary parts for leemons to work, making it fast, easy, and predictable. We use the [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) tool for managing the multi-container deployment, so there is less work to do and Leemons can be enjoyed even quicker!

You can install Docker and Docker Compose through [their website](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
